Quasar CLI is the pride of Quasar Framework. You can seamlessly build:

* a SPA (Single Page Application/Website),
* a SSR (Server-side Rendered App/Website),
* a PWA (Progressive Web App),
* a BEX (Browser Extensions),
* a Mobile App (through Cordova),
* an Electron App

...within the same project folder, ensuring you are **following the best Quasar practices while everything will simply work out of the box**.
